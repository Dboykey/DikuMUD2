"&lGeneral Notes:
	This is Wynd and Malice's zone.  The main idea of the zone is a
labyrinth which leads to a goblin city.  The main mobs of course are
goblins (levels 70-80).  Eventually the zone will be expanded to include a
castle.  This zone has been in progress since August of 1996, and
undergoes changes frequently.  If you have any questions reguarding this
zone, please e-mail Wynd/Wynne at pupalijl@wilkes1.wilkes.edu, or
Malice/Oops at garubaja@wilkes1.wilkes.edu.  All questions having to do
specifically with the Labyrinth may be directly referred to Wynd/Wynne. 

Special Thanks:
	I (Wynd/Wynne) would just like to give special thanks to those
individuals that have helped/supported me with the making of this zone. 
First, to Wonko, who sat with me and taught me how to write dil even when
I couldn't understand.  Second, to Rand and Eirinn, for all the help they
gave me when I couldn't find my mistakes.  Third, to Saor, Palio and
Whistler, for editing and checking the zone (and for letting it in). And
fourth, to everyone else, for your ideas and your patience (You know who
you are and I love you all).  A very special thanks to Malice/Oops, who
helped me realize my dream, and without whom this zone wouldn't be
possible.  Thank you all very much."
