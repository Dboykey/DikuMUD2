"Haon-Dor is the forest located west of Udgaard. The further west you travel
the darker and more dangerous the forest becomes. Beginners should never
go into the deep, dark forest beyond the dense forest.&n&n

Haon-Dor contains many small animals, a cabin, an orc camp and many other
secrets in the deep, dark, forest. There is a beginners quest at the cabin."
