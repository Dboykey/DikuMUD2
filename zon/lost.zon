"   A Cabalistic Familiar's Owner Manual

Congratulations on obtaining a Cabalistic familiar! Hopefully, you haven't
waked it up yet... it would be a good idea not to until you have found a god
to perform a Ritual of Bonding on you and your new familiar. At that point,
you might also ask the god about customizing your new familiar's name, title
and description!

WARNING! If you wake up your familiar before a god Bonds it to you, you are
unleashing a masterless spirit on the world. You will be it's first target.
You very likely might have to destroy it. If you are having problems
convincing a god to perform the Ritual for you you, please send mudmail to
Cabal, who will be glad to help.

Once bonded to you, the familiar is a wonderful companion. When carried in
inventory it actually sits on your shoulder and can interact with you and
the environment. The Ritual of Bonding forces the spirit to serve you in a
number of ways. It will make sure that you always have food and water in your
possession, even creating it for you if necessary. It will not, however, fight
for you... it is selfish and will only fight to save it's own hide.

The most important function of the basic familiar is the way it will defend
your possesions. If you should happen to perish, your familiar will gather
up your possesions from your corpse and teleport to the Udgaard village
temple to await your rebirth. It will automatically give you your possessions
once you see it again.

There have been some reports of strange events when more than one familiar
is in the same room, although nothing dangerous. If you want to keep your
familiar out of the way, just put it in a bag... If it gets injured in combat
and is forced to teleport to safety, it will go to the temple again to wait
for you. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILIAR ON YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE THE
GAME... it must be in your possession to be saved with your character.
