    Controlling a golem is easy. It will respond to either
    golem or to the name you gave it upon bonding. Simply
    TELL the golem any commands that a player could exectue,
    and the golem will try it's best to comply. These can
    range from expressive gestures like TELL GOLEM SMILE to
    useful actions like TELL GOLEM GET ALL. The familiar can
    use armor, weapons and magic items and gain the effects of
    those items. You can command a golem to attack
    with TELL GOLEM KILL (target)

    If you become seperated from your familiar, it will try
    to seek you out by walking to you.

    In addition, if you type STATUS GOLEM, your golem will
    report to you some of it's vital statistics.... (and this
    should actually be working now).

    You should keep your golem following you are
    all times. If you are forced to leave it behind somewhere,
    it will not be able to hear your commands (your telepathic
    link with the familiar requires you to be in the same room
    with you.) Horrible stories have been told about golems
    killing even their high level masters if they cease
    to be a Necromancer.
