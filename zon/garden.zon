notes
"In the middle of the dry arain desert, mysteriously a lush garden grows
like a tropical mirage. The thick foliage and cool water give refuge to
those lucky enough to stumble upon this place. 'The Garden of the Gods'
Commonly called 'The Garden Of Time', as time here seems to be endless
here, is a mystical and awe inspiring place where one can come and  relax
away from the hustle and bustle of fighting to survive...

The rules are here to help mortals have a better understanding of what
is and is not acceptable in the world of Valhalla. They include both
rules to be followed by mortals and by gods. Please try to keep these in
mind as you enjoy the world of Valhalla as when you ask help of the
immortals.

Note : The pillar has been updated due to the changes in PKing rules.

1) Gods will not interfere in normal play. This includes the following:
    -See 'help god'
    -No healing.
    -No summoning.
    -No helping to kill mobs.
    -No killing mortals for any reason (out of the arena).
    -No corpse retrievals except during a reboot.
    -No abuse of shouts.
    -No helping to locate objects or mobs.
    -No giving items to players except in cases of reimbursement <see
       reimbursement section>.
    -No abuses of crash bugs.
    -No helping their own mortals or other mortals their mortals are
       fighting with.
    -No repoping areas unless it is for testing purposes. <mortals may
        contact gods if they feel the repop time is to long.
    -No gods on line when thier mortal is on line.

2) Players will play in an acceptable fashion. This includes the following:
    -A max of two players per human player will be allowed on the mud at
     one time. You may own more then two players but you may only have two
     on line at any given time.
    -Characters must ALWAYS be under the control of a human player. NO
     bots/scripts or other non-human controlled action for any reason
     will be allowed.
    -No abuse of crash bugs.
    -Must report bugs to a higher god immediately upon finding it either
     via in person, email or mudmail.
    -No abuse of the shout channel in any form.
    -Do as a immortal asks you. If you do not agree with what is being
     asked then bring it up with another higher god. (within reason)
    -NEVER delete your char unless a god instructs you to. You will not
     be given your levels back.
    -No logging on as another player to shout or using another means of
     shouting if a god has noshouted you.
    -No logging in with obscene names.
    -No flaming players/gods on the boards/on the shouts or with new
     char names. Debate is ok flaming is not. If you have something to
     say then say it constructively. You may however flame them all you
     like in says, tells or on the soon to come complaints board.
    -No advertising for other muds in the open channels ie titles,
     boards, shouts. Tells and says and mail are ok.
    -After a reboot corpses left at the temple will be left as is. They
     are  put there by the gods from before the reboot.
    -Titles and renaming is a privilege. It will only be done in extreme
     special cases such as winning an online quest or somthing similar.
     Please do not ask for them.

3) Reimbursement will be given ONLY when loss is due to mud error such as
   loss after a 'crash'.
    -Only 1 complete set of amour will be returned to a player.
     Regardless of weather you have 3 sets of elemental amour. That
     includes weapons.
    -Quest items will be returned to you if you have the flag. If you got
     the item by any other means then doing the quest then you are out of
     luck.
    -Reimbursement will NOT be given due to corpse looting, lack of money,
     logging off and leaving your corpse, dropping something and expecting
     it to be there the next day <yes someone did this>, or giving it to
     a buddy and he/she loses it. Or any other means that does not
     involve game error.
    -Money to a max of 25 platinum OR 1 days rent will be returned in a
     reimbursement if you do not have money in the bank. So keep the money
     safe in the bank.

4) Re-rolls cost 10% of experience

5) Newbies Are protected by the great God of Valhalla.
   -You will not kill a newbie level 4 or under for any reason or by any
    method. (suggestions for annoying newbies...help them to get to level 5).
   -Continual transporting of a newbie without his/her permission or
    transporting a newbie to a place he/she does not want to be is not
    alloud.

6) Pking will only be alloud between Book of Blood signers. Type HELP PK
   and HELP BOB. ignorance of the rules will not be accepted as an excuse.

    These rules are subject to change. If you have any suggestions please
    send them to palio.
