     "This story has been handed down in my family for over
two hundred years, and even though I've never been On the
Top...  I believe it. Long ago, the people that populate
this town lived On the Top, that area that rests above our
town.  My people lived a very humble life, gathering what
they needed to survive from the earth. We farmed the land
and raised our livestock. We worshipped the land and the
spirits that gave us the means to survive. No one knows for
sure how it happened, but my family has a theory as to how
the curse came about.
     Whatever you want to blame it on, whether it be fate,
divine intervention, or plain old bad luck, On the Top was
cursed.  Somehow, the old king, King Zock, died. Now there's
a bit of mystery around that whole thing, but it ain't
important.  After the king was in the ground for about three
months, a lot of strange things started happenin'.  Babies
were stolen from their cribs in the middle of the night,
livestock were found completely eviscerated and drained of
all their blood, and strangest of all...graves were being
robbed. After King Jean-Jacques Zock died, there were no
other Zocks to take the throne, so the closest relative took
control. Now, these people not were really closely related
to the Zock's at all, but the island needed a ruler.  That's
when things started to get downright bizarre.
     King Maurquis took control and moved into the royal
palace with his wife and lovely daughter, Jadania.  One day,
Jadania went out for a walk in the Royal Forest and never
returned.  In the weeks that followed, the island was
searched from end to end.  Every pond, house, barn and farm
was checked. The guards went from house to house asking for
information, but no one knew a thing. The new king offered a
sizable reward for Jadania's return or any information that
might lead to her recovery.  Still, nothing turned up. After
many moons, and many tears on the part of the Maurquis
family, something did turn up. One evening, the king and his
wife were getting prepared for bed.  Pierre, the king,
feeling nature's call, adjourned to the royal toilet. While
the king was relieving himself before bed, Jadania returned
and fell to her mothers feet weeping.  It turns out that the
princess had been hiding in the Royal Forest for the past
months. It so happens that the king, who had never really
been royal in the first place, had a secret of his own.
Jadania had discovered that her father had
helped King Zock meet an untimely end.  While spending her
months amongst the evergreens and willows of the Royal
Forest, the princess met her lifelong husband.  A mountain
man full of secrets and revelating thoughts, soon swept
Jadania off her feet.  The young princess, believing her
father to be nothing more that an insensitive aristocratic
usurper, informed the Queen in areas of the Marquis' ascent.
The young girl told the queen all of this and proclaimed to
her loving mother that she would rather taste cold steel in
her heart than live under the same roof with her father.
When her mother asked the girl how she survived in the Dark
Woods all alone, Jadania simply said 'I wasn't alone...'.
With that, the princess slipped away into the shadows.
Outraged by the news given to her by her daughter, the Queen
confronted her husband.  The Queen threatened the King that
if he didn't relinquish the throne, she would be forced to
expose him, divulging his darkest secret.  Driven mad with
anger and greed, Pierre threw his wife from the terrace.
The Queen's body was found the next day and no one suspected
the King.
     In the years that followed, the bizarre occurrences
that had started out as random and thin spread began to increase.
People were found in their homes drained of all their blood.
The brain eaten corpses of small children, who were thought
to be lost, were found in the beds they were stolen from.
One old man was even found hanging by his own spinal cord in the
archway of the town hall. By this time, the townspeople were
mad with fear. They demanded that their king do something to
amend this problem, yet Pierre was feeble with guilt. The
suicide of his wife and the secret burning crime that he
forced on Jadania had almost taken its toll on Pierre. On
the third anniversary of King Zock's death, the Great Ultimatum
was given from the town hall, and the citizens gathered to
hear the kings address. The townspeople had grown tired of
King Maurquis' inability to stop all of the atrocities and
demanded an action be taken.  The king assured the people
that he was doing everything within his power to stop these
crimes, but his fear was evident in his voice.  Then, from
the audience that occupied the town hall's steps came a
voice: 'Listen not to the voice of The False King!'. The
king demanded that this treasonous person show himself. Out of
the crowd stepped the lovely Jadania, dressed in the ragged garb
of a peasant girl.  Pierre was overcome with happiness to
have his daughter back, but Jadania had other things besides
a reunion on her mind.  'These things are happening to our
people because our king is villainous! He is no King, I am
no royalty! The only true royalty are the Zock! These are the
ways foretold by the ancients. The ancients tell us that one
day a Zock will die wrongfully and a false king will rise!
This island is cursed now because my father has killed his
king and his own bride! Your children die because of your
king's unclean lust for power!' Driven mad by his
daughter's truthful accusations, Pierre drew his sword and
drove its cold steel into her heart. The townspeople were
appalled by this and the king was taken and lynched. That
day, King Pierre Maurquis' head rested atop a pike outside
the town hall. That day was the last day the sun ever
shined.
     It is said in my family that the Vampire King fell in
love Jadania when she escaped to the forest. He declared war
on the living because of what the king had done to her.
Forevermore, the living would suffer because the Vampire
King was robbed of his true love. The following years were
black and disease ridden.  The corpses of fathers were coming home
to claim their son's warm flesh, the dead were rising and
waging war on the living. In some regions, animals were
becoming human, a plague was being spread through the water,
and all around...the mark of 'Z' was left as a calling card.
After many years of battle, the majority of the island
became a wasteland of blackness and graves.  This once peaceful
farming island was reduced to nothing more a breeding ground
for the undead. Eventually, the war between the living and
the dead became too much.  Luckily, my ancestors escaped to
the caverns beneath the island and Sanctuary was found. My
people were human once, long ago when we escaped to
Sanctuary, but over the years we have adapted to our
underground home. We developed the large oval eyes and the
disfigurements as a result of our decades in these dark,
dank caverns. Or at least that's what my grandfather told me..."
