notes
"The ideas and the creation of the zone is made by THE three rotten members.
Rowan, Ramon and Realgar The Rotten. Iznogood is the same person as Realgar
and Wombat is the same person as Rowan. Realgar and Rowan would also like to
give a special thanks to Jem, Palio and Whistler for their help and support.

The City ThorBardin is an old dwarf city, which were prosperous before the
great war. After the war many things had changed and ThorBardin was forgotten
and left to decay.
Then one day a rowdy group of Rotten bandits found the ruins of the once great
city - ThorBardin. They established a business of their own - Murder Inc.
They created a cartel of murder and corruption and made their hideout in the
Rotten Club. But as time went on and the Rotten bandits grew in power, the law
began to fight the Rotten bandits with their own methods and finaly the law
was once again established in ThorBardin.
Although the law was victorious, the Rotten bandits didn't leave ThorBardin
completely, they still have their hideout, where there can think out their
wicked plans.
P.S. People might find the law a bit corrupt, but that is one of the result
for being with the Rotten bandits.
NOTE: There are also monsters in ThorBardin, which have sought shelter after
the war and in time they have grown in power.

was before the great war began. During the war it was an important stronghold
for the dwarves, but they had to abandon it when the evil forces overran the
country. After the war the city was forgotten and was left behind in decay.
Until one day when a band of the rotten bandits found the ruins of the city.
They claimed the city as their property and used it as a hideout.

"This mighty city - ThorBardin (City of Dwarves), was created by Dwarven and
Elven hands in the time of peace. They rised two cities as a symbol of their
friendship, the dwarves did all the stonework and the elves did all the
woodenwork. It was two magnificiant cities one for the dwarves and one for
the elves. Then the war began and destroyed the Elves city and the Dwarven
city was left behind when the dwarves fled. Then one day a rowdy group of
Rotten bandits found the long lost ThorBardin, they examined the city and
finaly claimed ThorBardin. The city started to grow again, powerful people
which didn't care what kind of people there where trading with began to trade
with the Rotten bandits. During the Rotten bandits time of bloody raids, the
nobles and the king tried to fight them and finaly they got a breakthrough
and law was once again established in ThorBardin. But the Rotten bandits still
had their hideout, which even today makes the streets of ThorBardin insecure.
Only the strongest who didnt fear the Rottens or had a deal with them stayed
in the city for good, others just passes through.

"HOW TO BREW THE PERFECT POISON (BEGINNERS LEVEL):
First of all you need a strong cooking pot, since you also need the heat of
a red dragons breath. The ingredients are simple: The goodness of evil Iggys
heart, the wicked thought of the Master Paladin, the trust of Loki and then
a red dragons breath to cook it all together. Hints!!! Loki is simple, you
can either pay him of OR simply just give him an offer he can't refuse. Then
there is the Paladin, here you have to find a beautiful lady who can play
with the Paladins mind (GOOD LUCK - THEY ARE SO BORING!). Now you only need
one thing - Iggys goodness, well that one you need to figure out yourself.
When you are done with those simple little items, you only need to cook em.
Here you will encounter the REAL problem, how to make the dragon stand still.
It is almost impossible, we lost 8756 men under the cooking!!!!
P.S Good luck ;-)

Well we didnt really found a way to remove it besides death. Because i
couldn't get any more men from the Commitee Of Remove Poison Without Killing

12876 gnomes to find the right cure for the poison. So i had to stop the
creation of RPPWD - Remove Poison Potion Without Death.

"HOW TO MAKE A STONE TASTE LIKE CHICKEN (ADVANCED LEVEL):
First you need a stone, not just any stone. No you shall get the stone of
ice and boil it until a dragon burn its claws, here is a small problem you
need a dragon so it can burn its claws. Then you need the heart of a living
devil, that could also give you some difficulties since devils don't like to
give their hearts away. Don't worry the last ingredient is simple - a chicken
Please send me a copy, if you ever get to make this stone taste like chicken,
because i never did it. The Commitee Of Stop The Horrible Killings stopped my
project after the death of 23765 gnomes.
