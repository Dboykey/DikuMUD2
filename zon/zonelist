# Format is as follows:
#
# 1. Zonename
#    The on-disk filename of the zone.
#
# 2. Password
#    Used solely for the (email/ftp) zone compiler
#
# 3. Compile time errors
#    Used solely for the (email/ftp) zone compiler. When set to 0
#    the zone is compiled with the dmc flag '-l' which causes all
#    warnings to be treated as errors. Used for beginner / non-trusted
#    builders.
#
# 4. Reset priority and 'runtime priviliges'
#    The primary purpose of this field, is to set in which order zones
#    are reset at boot-time. It is important that "basic" zones are reset
#    first, since there is a delay of 1 - 2 seconds between each zone reset.
#    The second purpose is to set what access the zone is allowed via DIL.
#    When set to '0' it means the zone has 'root' privileges and is allowed
#    to do stuff that can be ultimately destructive to the mud. This should
#    only be set by Paps and is only intended for the basis.zon to make
#    spell implementation via DIL possible.
#
# 5. Load-level
#    The load-level can be set individually for each zone. The load level
#    is overridden if the person attempting to load is the creator of the
#    zone in question (i.e. in the %zone creators {...} ).
#
# 6. Pay only
#    Set to 0 if anyone can play.
#    If set to "1" only players with a credit larger > 0 can play here.
#    If set to "2" only players with an active flatrate can play here.
#    If set to "3" players can play here with either of the above options.
