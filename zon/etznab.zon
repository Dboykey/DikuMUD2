notes
"This zone is designed for PC levels within the approximate&n
range of 15 through 25.  Its placement in the MUD-world is&n
just south of Midgaard.  This zone concentrates on rooms and&n
mobiles, and is rather limited as far as objects go, mainly&n
because I designed it to be an exp and room zone, not an&n
equipment zone.  If you have any comments or questions, please&n
feel free to email me at: mon2@ix.netcom.com&n
&n
Changes:&n
(o) 8/15/96 - Changed all mobs to macros instead of manual settings&n
(o) 8/14/96 - Finished all room, touched up on dil, and killed myself&n
	       trying to find all the stupid errors&n
(o) 7/25/96 - Added smell and listen commands to zone&n
(o) 7/23/96 - Added all mob DIL&n
(o) 7/22/96 - Added breeze DIL&n
(o) 2/21/97 - Corrected inifinite link from d_woods6&n
(o) 2/21/97 - Decided to add a help section&n

"You are standing at the northern edge of the ancient Etz-Nab woods, just
outside the south gate of Midgaard.  As you survey your surroundings
you see that the woods continue out of sight to the south, and the edge
runs to the east and west.  The air has a crisp smell to it, which makes
you feel alive and energetic.  The ground beneath your feet is covered
in soft moss which has migrated out of the forest and up the small
incline you are standing on.  From here you can travel north to the
great city of Midgaard, follow the trail south into the woods, or
parallel the edge of the woods by following the path east or west.
As you glance around you, you also notice a &c+rBIG SIGN&cw demanding

see ten or eleven meters away before your view is entire blocked by trunks.
The ground covered in dried leaves, making your journey very noisy, although
also very easy.  The air is very crisp and refreshing, filling your lungs
with what feels like pure joy.  There are _many_ kinds of trees surrounding
you, cottonwood, aspen, oak, willow, even pine trees are scattered throughout
the area.  This area is rich with sights, sounds, and smells, which somehow
gives you the urge to 'listen' and 'smell'.  The woods  thicken to the south,

place indeed.  Simply standing here makes your skin crawl.
  The trees are packed so densely together that you cannot
see more then four meters in any direction.  The canopy of the
trees above your head blocks nearly 90 percent of the light.
The spooky affect is only amplified by a dark, low to the ground
fog which, although there is no wind whatsoever, moves swiftly
along the ground and about your feet.  Through breaks in the

leaves and other such rotting materials. You get the feeling

"You are standing deep within the Etz-Nab woods, here is a strange
place indeed.  Simply standing here makes your skin crawl.
  The trees are packed so densely together that you cannot
see more then four meters in any direction.  The canopy of the
trees above your head blocks nearly 90 percent of the light.
The spooky affect is only amplified by a dark, low to the ground
fog which, although there is no wind whatsoever, moves swiftly
along the ground and about your feet.  Through breaks in the
fog, you can make out that the ground cover consists of very damp
leaves and other such rotting materials. You get the feeling
that a prolonged stay in this area would be counterproductive
to your health.  The deep woods continue to the north and south
while there appears to be a &c+bhuge&cw tree to the east."
