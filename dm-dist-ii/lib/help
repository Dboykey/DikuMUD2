What follows is a partial list of the topics which can currently be
found in the help files.  Thus, by typing 'help' followed by any of the
following terms you should be able to get information.  Please note that
this list was accurate as of January 1996, and may become out of date
over time.&n&n

Note that this is only a PARTIAL list and that there are other terms which
may be used to get to the same information. For example, typing 'help me'
will give you the same file as you would get typing 'help newbie' or 'help
beginner'.  Most of these terms may be abbreviated, so that typing 'help com'
would give the same information as 'help commands'.&l

login

Welcome to Valhalla. To login as a new player, you must first pick
a name and then select a password. If you are prompted for a password
just after picking the name, it means that the name is already in use
by another player. Then just hit enter and try a different name.&n&n

You are not making any commitments so just continue the login procedure,
you can always make a new player if you pick a wrong choice. To get more
help, you can write help followed by the word on which you want help,
for example:&l
   &c+whelp password&cw.&n&n
#
"password"

You must select a password for your player. The password can be up to
8 characters long but must be at least five characters long. The password
must contain both letters and non-letters.&l

         Valid Examples              Invalid Example

&fPlease do not select one of the above passwords!
For your information, your password is encrypted and is unreadable even
to the administration.&n&n
#
"maiden name"

Here you should enter a piece of information which is personal, very easy
to remember and known just by you and your closets relatives, for example
your mother's maiden name. We will require this information if you need
us to change your password or otherwise modify your player per request.&n
&c+wIf we do not have this information we can not help you if you forget
your player's password!!&cw&l

 > help personal email
#
"personal email"

You can optionally supply us with your e-mail address if you have one.
We will use this information to mail you about any events which are
important enough to clutter your mailbox.&n&n

The e-mail can also be used both to supplement the maiden name which you
have hopefully entered.&l

 > help maiden name
#
genders sex male female

You can choose to be either a male player or a female player. For most
races males are somewhat taller than females whereas the females tend to
have a longer lifespan.&n&n
Your choice does not nessecarily have to reflect your real gender, but most
of the players play their own gender since they find it difficult to
impersonate the opposite gender. &l

  > help login races
#
"login races"

When you login with as a new player you can choose to be a &c+whuman&cw,
&c+welven&cw, &n&c+wdwarven&cw, &c+whalfling&cw or &c+wgnomen&cw race.
Each of these races vary in height, weight, lifespan, and abilities
to master various arts.&n&n
If you are unsure what any of this means, pick the human race as it is
the best overall race.&l

  > help human
  > help dwarf
  > help elf
  > help halfling
  > help gnome
#
personality

The choice of personality has an impact on how other beings in the world
interacts with you. Some guilds or societies may for example reject players
with evil personailities.&n&n
Choosing neutral or good will keep you out of most trouble.
#
"login guilds"

Initially you can choose to become a member of any four guilds (there are
many more, but they are not suited for novice players). The guild determines
what skills you can learn and have a major impact on how you get yourself
out of trouble.&l

  > help fighter
  > help thief
  > help conjurer
  > help healer
#
fighters "udgaard fighter"

The strong warrior is usually quite strong. The character will be able
to lift and carry a alot around, and will have good constitution
as well. This class enables the use and skill of greater weapons
and armours. You don't hit too often - but when you do you hit hard.
#
thiefs "udgaard thief" thieves robbers

This class gives the character good dexterity, thus making it
easy to learn skills, and master weapons which require a high
degree of dex. The thief is often unpopular with both players and
monsters due to his highly questionable skills.
#
conjurers "udgaard conjurer" magicians

The elite of magic with the cunning to match. This class gives
your character good possibilities for learning magic spells.
Some of these spells can defend you from the hostile world
surrounding you.
#
healers "udgaard healer" priests clerics

This gives you almost a direct tap of the divine forces of the
universe. You will use your healing and creation spells to fight
off all evil.
#
humans

The humans tend to be the average race which gives you no special advantages,
but nearly no setbacks. The human race is ideal for developing a "jack of all
trades" and is a good choice for a new player.&n&n

Humans typically have a lifespan of 90 years, males are taller and heavier
than females but have a shorter lifespan. A human player begins his career
when 16 to 19 years old.
#
elves elfs elven

The elven race is the closest thing to the human race, although very
different. Elves are, by human standards, a very beautiful and artistic
people which grow incredibly old. Elves are an outdoor people, fond of
nature and all which is beautiful.&n&n

Elves are shorter and lighter than humans, and have always been noted
as being intelligent and divine beings, though not very strong in magic.
Elves have a lifespan of 1200 years or older, and begin thier careers
between the 190th - 215th year.
#
dwarfs dwarven dwarves

Dwarves are a hard working, stubborn people. They show a great interest
in all which is valueable - especially gold. Dwarves usually live in great
underground cityes constructed deep in the heart of mountains. The dwarves
are unparalleled in mining, masonry and architechtural skills.&n&n

The dwarves are not, as many think, less intelligent than humans.
Through their smaller size, the dwarves they have built up a much better
constitution and strength making them deadly and fierce warriors. They
are horrible at using magic but some dwarves are known to be clerics.
#
halflings

Quick and dexterous, but not that strong. Many halflings
seek the wonders of magic or thievery to defend themselves.
#
gnomes

Small and quick. They mostly rely on magic to defend themselves,
as their foes almost always seem stronger than them. They are
probably the most intelligent humanoid race.
#
races

The different races form different characters. Each race has its own
advantages. One race may be characterized as being dexterous, others as
strong. The table below lists how hard / easy it is for a race to gain
in abilities. Note however that races also affect the cost of skills,
spells && weapons (these are not listed as the list is veeery long):&l

               Human  Elf     Dwarf   Halfling  Gnome

Magic           AVG   HARD    VHARD   EASY      VEASY

   character.

   The elves have always been noted as being intelligent and divine
   beings, though not very strong in magic.

Dwarfs

   But through their smaller size, they have built up a much better
   constitution and strength. They are horrible at using magic but

   seek the wonders of magic or thievery to defend themselves.

me newbie beginners

To the absolute beginner:&n&n

Welcome to Valhalla. We hope you'll enjoy playing this game. You are now
playing a character in the game. You control this character by typing in
commands and pressing <enter> telling the game to execute the command. If
text is written on the screen while you are writing the command, just
continue with whatever you were typing, what you have written will NOT be
lost.&l

The first commands that you will want to know are these:
   >look           and also 'look at <item>' and 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >west           -------------------- west  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.

&fAll commands can be abbreviated. Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated
to just 'l'. Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them. Be careful! Learn which abbreviations
trigger which commands. For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not
'say', here you must use the abbreviation 'sa' for 'say'.&n&n

If you haven't saved your character yet, you are here as a guest and your
character is forgotten as soon as you quit. If you decide to begin playing
seriously, use the save command to keep your character.&n&n

If you need further help, try to use the help command differently, by putting
a word behind it, such as 'help commands' which will show you a sample of
commands. 'help' followed by a command often reveals the full use of a command.
Try this on 'look'.&n&n

To say something type 'say' and a space, and then the sentence you wish to say.
For example 'say hello world!' (don't type the '').&n&n

To quit playing, type 'quit'.&n&n

Guilds are the primary way of improving your abilities in this game, as well

enough experience points to raise a level you may go to your guild and train
in these abilities, skills, and spells, thus increasing your ability to
battle tougher and tougher monsters.

There are at least four basic guilds in this game and you have selected
one of them when you started your character. To see which commands are
available in a guild, find the guildmaster and look at the sign hanging
next to him.&l

laws jail wanted reward justice protected crimes arrests captain

An entire law system is built into Valhalla. All players and all monsters
belonging to any major cities, castles and villages are protected by the
law. You are not allowed to kill or steal from people which are protected,
unless they are caught in the act of stealing or killing PROTECTED characters.
&n&n

If you witness a crime you can accuse the person which committed the crime
at the city guard Captain. The Captain is usually located at the city guard
headquarters. If a protected npc witness a crime it will walk to the
captain and accuse the offender.&n&n

If you have committed a certain number of crimes the guards may attempt to
arrest you. Once they handcuff you it is possible to attempt an escape by
typing 'break' to attempt breaking the handcuffs.&n&n

If you have committed several crimes after having been declared 'wanted'
you will be 'wanted dead or alive'. This means that you are no longer
protected by the law system. At this point there will be a reward on your
head, offering both money and experience for your death. All guards attack
on sight. Players are allowed to kill you.&n&n

Once in jail you have to wait for some pretty strong friends to free
you or for a long time to pass.&n&n

Your misdeeds are forgotten if you get killed or when you have served
your jail sentence. But beware *any* crime reported after being cleared
will make you a criminal instantly.&l

commands

&l&c+wUsage:&cw

   >commands

&fThis command gives a complete listing of all immediately available commands.
There might however be specific commands not listed here that are useable
elsewhere.&n&n

This is a listing of some of the most common commands. All commands can be
abbreviated, experiment to find out.&l

communications say shout tell whisper ask communicate yell talk

&l&c+wUsage:&cw
   >say <words to speak>
   >' <words to speak>
   >shout <words to shout>
   >whisper <character> <words to whisper>
   >ask <character> <word asking for something?>
   >tell <character> <words to tele-communicate>

&fAt a point in playing Valhalla you wish to communicate with other players
you can do so in many different ways. You can speak out, shout (limit this,
as most other players find it annoying), whisper to someone, ask someone
something, or even telecommunicate to others. Beware that immortals or gods
can intercept any message you deliver or receive (although it is considered
rude to do so!)&l

&c+wSay and '&cw

Say can be abbreviated to a '. Be warned if you forget this unfortunate
things can happen, for example:
   >' hi god
   >hi papi
OOPS! you're now fighting Papi! surely not your intention, so watch out.

&c+wAsk&cw

Mostly same as say, except this is directed as a character question. Only
the character you're asking will hear the question.

&c+wShout&cw

This is quite a powerful command. If you use shout, everybody playing on the
mud will hear you! (except for the ones sleeping, and those who have set
themselves to nos). Limit the use of this! Many players (and gods) find
it rather annoying when everybody runs around shouting to each other.
Find a better way of communicating (see below). Shout will use up some of
your endurance points.

&c+wTell&cw

A very good alternative to shout. This enables you to communicate via
telepathy with a character who for one reason or another is not at the same
location as you are. No other player will hear this. Be warned that a player
can stop receiving tells by using the not (no tell) command.

&c+wWhisper&cw

A cute alternative to tell if the one you wish to communicate with is at the
same location. Unlike tell others will notice that you whisper something (but
they will not know what it is you're whispering).

#
change rows columns

&lYou can use this command to change the way the mud outputs text to you.

  rows is how many lines of text the mud prints before it puts out a
  `*** Press return ***'.  (Default is 22)

  columns is how many characters there is put on a line... currently this
  only works with a fraction of the text-output, but Gnort is working on
  expanding this.  (Default is 80)

Example (for you c64-folks out there):

   >change columns 40
#
prompt display

&l&c+wUsage:&cw
   >prompt

&fThis command toggles your prompt between the good old "> " and a prompt
displaying your mana, endurance and hit-points, for example "100m/80e/42h> "
(100 Mana, 80 Endurance and 42 hitpoints).
#
alias unalias dictionary claim

&l&c+wUsage:&cw
   >alias
   >alias foo
   >alias foo bar [; baz]
   >unalias foo [bar ...]
   >claim <dictionary>

&fTo use the alias command you must have one of the special dictionaries in
your possession. They will be for sale somewhere.&n&n

No arguments will list all your defined aliases.
One argument will list the alias in question (in this case `foo').
Any other number of arguments will result in the first word of the argument
to become an alias for the remainder.&n&n

Unalias will undefine all the aliases listed as its argument.
Claim is used for initializing a dictionary, but you will only have to type
this once when you first start using it.  It will then remember its owner.&n&n

Various special control characters are available in aliases:&l

  You can combine commands with the semicolon ';'

  You can insert various parts of an argument in an alias-text using the
  ampersand '&&'.  The first occurence of '&&' will get the first word of the
  argument, the second '&&' the second word etc.  The final '&&' will be
  substituted to the remainder of the argument.

  An optional number (1 - 9) immediately after the '&&' will be substituted to
  the correspondingly numbered word of the argument, but will not affect the
  argument-count used to calculate the remainder for usage in the last '&&',
  except when the last '&&' in the alias-string is followed by a number in
  which case the remainder of the argument is suppressed.

This is apparently easier to use than explain :)

Examples:

   >alias ge get && from &&; eat &&1
   >alias gb ge bread bag
   >alias gs ge steak sack

The alias 'gb' will then mean 'get bread from bag; eat bread' and the
commands will be carried out in that order.  Alternatively 'gs' will mean
'get steak from sack; eat steak'.

   >alias say emote whispers almost inaudibly '&&'
Will make the say command have another 'look' for others, ie:
   >say Hello, friends
Gnort whispers almost inaudibly 'Hello, friends'

Notice that 'sa' will still work as the original say-command, as aliases
don't check for abbreviations, unlike the command interpreter.

Any inconsistency with the few rules new aliases are required to uphold will
be checked when trying to add it, and you will recieve a `meaningful' error
message pointing at what mistake(s) you made.

Notice that ANY and all use of ';' and '&&' in an alias will be interpreted
as that characters special meaning. Ie:

   >alias greet say Hi Quinn && God !! ;-)

will substitute the '&&' with whatever argument 'greet' will be given or
simply the empty string.  Thus the alias 'greet' with no arguments will
yield the commands: 'say Hi Quinn  God !! ' and '-)', the latter of which
will give an error message from the interpreter (Unless aliased of course).

If too many &&'s are used in an alias and the expanded string gets too large,
that entire alias-execution will be aborted, and you will have to make
another version of the alias.
#
xp experience levels

&l&c+wSyntax:&cw
   >level [now]

&fThe level command is used to raise a level. This is because the training
system keeps track of how many times you practice per level. When you issue
the level command you raise a level, gain your ability and skill points,
and can start a new (cheap) training session.&n&n

Experience is usually gained by killing monsters. The experience you gain is
relative to your level compared to the monsters level.&n&n

You gain no experience when killing players.&n&n

If you are in wimpy mode you'll only gain 50%.&n&n

If you are good and kill evil you get a bonus. Vice versa but not as large.&l

pk "player killing"

Killing and stealing is generally frowned upon on in Valhalla, although it
is not forbidden.  If you are caught killing another player or stealing,
you can be turned in at one of the guard offices, and the city authorities
are then likely to post a reward for your head.  Guards will attack you on
site, and certain other special individuals, such as bounty hunters, may
become interested in you.&n&n

Generally we discourage PK'ing and we might interfere in some situations.&l

alignment good evil neutral

&lYou can have a good, evil or neutral alignment.

  Good alignments range from +350 to +1000, with +1000 being ultimately good.

  Evil alignments range from -350 to -1000, with -1000 being ultimately evil.

  Neutral alignments range from +349 to -349, with 0 being true neutral.

&fIt is hard to uphold alignments of good and evil, while it is very easy to
stay neutral. Killing bad guys makes you 'good' while killing good guys makes
you more 'evil'. If your alignment should reach -1000, it will stay there
unless you perform a quest to have it changed.

warrior fighter

The fighter is a player which is devoted mostly to melee combat, using
weapons or hands. There are two main attributes for warriors:&l

   Strength (STR)
      Strength determines how hard you hit.

   Dexterity (DEX)
      Dexterity determines how quick the warrior is. The faster the
      warrior the less likely he is to be hit, and the more likely
      he is to hit his opponents.

   Weapon Skill
      The weapon skill is the most important skill for the warrior.
      It is his knowledge about his weapon and his enemy's weapons.
      The skill is used together with DEX to determine if he can hit
      or defend himself properly.

   Regaining hit-points
      The warrior regains his hit-points through his constitution.
      The higher the constitution the faster he regains his
      hit-points.

clerics priests mages "magic users" "spell casters" wizards

The SPELL CASTER is a player which is devoted to using the
magic which is present in the universe. There are two very distinct
classes of magic - 'divine (DIV)' and 'magic (MAG)'. Clerics use
DIV as their power, whereas magic users use MAG.&l

There are two main attributes for spell casters:

   Power (DIV or MAG)
      Power determines how powerful a spell is when it hits the
      opponent. The better the power the better the effect of
      the spell. This can be compared with a warrior's strength.

   Brain (BRA)
      When the spell caster casts a spell he will experience a
      'battle of the mind' which determines if he can hit the
      opponent. Brain determines how smart the spell caster is.
      The smarter the spell caster the less likely he is to be
      hit, and the more likely he is to hit the opponent when
      he casts a spell. Brain can be compared with a warrior's
      dexterity.

   Spell Skill
      The spell skill is the most important skill for the spell caster.
      It is his knowledge about his spells (his weapon and means of
      survival) and his enemy's spells. The skill is used together
      with BRA to determine if he can hit or defend himself properly.
      At the same time the skill also offers resistance against magic
      of the same type. For example a very proficient fire using spell
      caster is partially immune to small fire attacks.

   Regaining MANA points
      The magic user regains his mana points through his charisma.
      When the charisma matches the magic power (see above) the gain
      occurs at a steady rate. When charisma is above the power gaining
      is even faster and when below the gain rate slows down.

classes thief thieves fighters magicians warriors priests clerics ranger

&lFighter
  The strong warrior is usually quite strong. The character will be able
  to lift and carry a lot around, and will have good constitution
  as well. This class enables the use and skill of greater weapons
  and armours. You don't hit too often - but when you do you hit hard.

Thief
  This class gives the character good dexterity, thus making it
  easy to learn skills, and master weapons which require a high
  degree of dex. The thief is often unpopular with both players and
  monsters due to his highly questionable skills.

Magician
  The elite of magic with the cunning to match. This class gives
  your character good possibilities for learning magic spells.
  Some of these spells can defend you from the hostile world
  surrounding you.

Cleric
  This gives you almost a direct tap of the divine forces of the
  universe. You will use your healing and creation spells to fight
  off all evil (or perhaps become a priest of the netherworld and
  animate all dead?).

mana mana-points "mana points" power

Mana is the energy used by magic users and clerics. Mana has a maximum
of 100 and each spell uses a certain amount of mana. When you have 0
mana you can not cast any more spells.&n&n

The magic user (and cleric) regains his mana points through his charisma.
When the charisma matches the magic power (see above) the gain
occurs at a steady rate. When charisma is above the power gaining
is even faster and when below the gain rate slows down.&n&n

gain regenerate

At short intervals you gain hit, mana and endurance points (unless you're
hungry or thirsty). In general, if you're sitting you gain faster than
if you're standing. If you are resting you gain faster than when you're
standing. Sleeping and resting make you gain at equal rates.&n&n

When you are in sacred places you gain at double the normal rate.
Here are some of the sacred places in Midgaard:&l

   The Chicken's Rest   in Udgaard
   The Temple           in Udgaard
   Park Circle          in the park (south-east part of Midgaard).
   Inner sanctum        in the Midgaard Cathedral.
   Infirmary            in the Udgaard Monastery.

advanced time date

Advanced info about Valhalla:&n&n

The time in the game runs 12 times faster than real time, thus each
hour is 5 minutes long, and each day is 2 hours long. There are 14
days per month and a total of nine months per year. Thus a Valhalla
month passes in 28 hours, and a year passes in 252 hours (10 days
and 12 hours).&n&n

In one real year 35 Valhalla years pass.&n&n

weapons

Weapons are divided into many different categories. Your ability in such a
category decide how well you handle attacking with such a weapontype, but
also how well you  defend against that weapontype. If you are good at
handling a specific weapon, you will defend against such a weapon as well
as your ability goes.&n&n

To see which type your weapon is simply look at it (in shops, the type is
listed on the right hand side of the 'list').

practice practise train

&l&c+wUsage:&cw
   >practice <skill>

Examples:
   >practice strength
   >practice hand axe

&fThis command enables you to raise your abilities, and practice your
skills, spells and weapons. The command can only be used at a teacher.
Different teachers teach different abilities and skills, spells or weapons
and the cost is different in each guild. Your race also modifies this cost.
&n&n

When you look at your 'status' you will notice you have got a certain
amount of skill and ability practice points. The skill-points are used
for practicing spells, weapons and skills. The ability-points
are used for practicing abilities (str, dex, con, etc).&n&n

All your abilities and knowledge about spells, weapons and skills
are in the range [0..200] percent. You can only get above 150% by
finding magic items or very unique special teachers.&n&n

Each time you raise a level you get more skill and ability points, and
thus you can get better abilities and better spell, weapon and
skill knowledge.&l

info

&l&c+wUsage:&cw
   >info

Examples:
   >info
   >info hand axe
   >info category sword
   >info cat swo  (abbreviated)
   >info shield
   >info burn

&fThis command is used along with 'practice' at teachers.&n&n

When at a teacher try to type 'info'. At a weapon teacher you would be
displayed all the possible weapon categories to choose from. Select a
category for furter investigation, for example 'info cat a ham'. You could
get a reply similar to this:&l

Category axe hammer
    hand axe             [Now   1%, next  16, 5 ip]
    war hammer           [Now   2%, next  24, 5 ip]
    battle axe           [Now   0%, next  15, 5 ip]
    war mattock          [Now  62%, Practice next level]

You have 55 practice points left.

&fWhenever any skill, spell or weapon appears without information to the
right, it means that it is a category and you can't practice it - it
is just there to make things less cluttered.&n&n

This is an example of what the info to the right means - let's take the
war hammer above as an example:&l

   You currently got 62% skill in war hammer. If you want to
   practice the next point, it will cost you 24 skill points and
   5 iron pieces.

&fThat's it. Exactly the same goes for spells, skills and abilities.&l

armors armours shields

Armours are used to protect yourself against damage.

Shields are an addition to aromours which makes it possible to
completely block certain types of attacks and spells like for
example long sword attack and energy bolt. Some attacks are
partially reduced by shields, such as the morning star, and
fire storm. Finally, some attacks are unaffected by shields
such as a whip and poisonous gas attacks.

immortal god

The immortals on this game are those who have played the game for some time
and have now chosen to become programmers and adminstrators.  As a rule you
should not bother an immortal player as they are generally on the game to
test something or to speak with a specific player.  Occasionally immortal
players will arrange an online quest or other event. However, immortals
are generally barred from interfering with mortal players and can be
deleted from the game for doing so.
