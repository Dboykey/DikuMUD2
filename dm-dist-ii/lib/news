&l&h                            Valhalla Times
                           18th of January

   Successful start of Valhalla. Unfortunately, the harddisk controller
   board shortcircuted and destroyed our entire configuration.
   We have been working nightshift and are now up again, albeit a few
   things are not as good as they were. This will be corrected as soon
   as we get some sleep.
