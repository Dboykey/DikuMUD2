notes
"A complete history of the Nine Planes of Hades area can be found in the notes
section of Hades1.  All maintenance, creation, and coding of this zone is
currently coordinated by Tyk, Joeboo, and Kira.  Direct all questions and
comments to Tyk (Dan Banick) at ddb2@po.cwru.edu.  Any information following
this paragraph is original notes by the zones first creator, and may not be
current.

This zone was written as a collaborative effort by Tyk and Joeboo.  It
is not huge, as it is merely a single plane of hell but we none-the-less
included a major amount of DIL and a quest.  Its theme is the Abyss and it is
dominated by a huge pit in which souls are being tossed by a greater demon.
The entrance to the 7th plane is at the bottom of the pit and only accessible
after the demons quest has been made.  Otherwise you can simply fight the
multiple imps and devils forcing souls into the Abyss to be eaten by the soul
munchers.  Direct questions and comments to Kyt/Tyk(Dan) at ddb2@po.cwru.edu.
Special thanks to Kira for mucho help in DIL coding and Zandar for the use of
his beloved Artic Wind.  This zone was sponsored by Palio and Whistler. &n
-Nov 24 deshpande changed to fit the new dual wield category it falls under for 
+ability stats&n 
-Changed load name on soul bracelet and pendant to prevent old ones from
burning. Jan 1 1997&n 
-May 17 - Eirinn changed mob levels and items to fit the new limits (properly). Also put deshpande back in as a single handed sword, but prevents use of another weapon. It is now also a quest item. Mornick's quest was made harder  but you also need to kill him to get the sword.

"&lThe Nine Planes of Hades generally contain the following level mobiles:
	Tiamat Temple  30-40          Hades5      80-90
	Hades1         40-50          Hades6      90-100
	Hades2         50-60          Hades7     100-110
	Hades3         60-70          Hades8     110-120
	Hades4         70-80          Hades9     120-130

The entirety is a NO SUM/NO TELE area with the exception of Hades 5 and the
occasional special item or room.  Once inside, you generally need to walk
to either the first, fifth, or ninth plane to exit.

The basic layout of this zone is the entrance hallway from the
fifth plane, the edge of the Abyss, and several levels down into the
Abyss from the edges.  From the platform in the center you can also
be thrown into the center as part of a quest and eventually access to
the 7th plane.  Several mobs in the Abyss are aggressive and spend
time eating souls or players as hunger dictates.  The quest is fairly
simple and serves to break an otherwise monotonous slaughter fest
through Hell. "
