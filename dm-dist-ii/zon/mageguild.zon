"This is a zone designed to implement the Guild for Mages. The zone is
not a part of Midgaard, since it is too large already. The zone
contains teachers and guards. Lifespan of zone is very high in order
to encourage members to defend their guild.&n
June 4th, 1996 - Spellweaver Charm added as guild item by Sk(r)ay.&n

"&l
The College of Arcane Arts was build in the place of the old Conjurers
Guild, which itself replaced the older Mage Guild of Udgaard. The College
is a rich institution, able to afford pompous buildings as well as large
area and own defences.

	&c+wJoining the Guild&cw

	To join the guild, visit Rafizir the Archcancellor
	(all the way east from the entrance) and 'join'.
	You must leave your old guild in order to join the
	Academy of Arcane Arts. The cost of joining is 1 SP.

	&c+wLeaving the Guild&cw

	Leaving the guild can be done by insulting the
	Archcancellor. This will also cause a fee of 5 GP.
	Students who leave the Academy will not be re-enlisted.

	&c+wTraining/Education&cw

  Spell Practice	- Tower of Arcane, all south from the Main Hall.
  Skill Practice	- Main Lecture Hall, east and south from the Main Hall.
  Weapon Practice	- Tower of Mundane, all north from the Main Hall.
  Ability Practice	- The Library, east and north from the Main Hall.

	&c+wOther services&cw

  Title change		- At the Archcancellor, type 'title' to gain a new
			  and hopefully better title.
  Academy items		- Personal magical trinkets of the Conjurers. Those
			  are avaliable at the Archcancellor by bowing or
			  worshipping him.
  Bar and relaxation 	- A small resting area, along with a bar, can be found
			  in the College Gardens (north and east or south
			  and east from the Main Hall).
