light that hits it, denying your eyes any view of the depths." \

 You feel your sense of hope swallowed along with it." \

tangible, and it seems to withdraw as your boat passes through it. It feels \
 almost alive." \

good exercise ground for horses. The courtyard itself is ringed with a fortified \
wall which must have been built to protect the Temple from those who would \
destroy or damage it." \

around it. There appear to be two floors to it." \

Emalon in the Year of Hiding.' These must be the original stones, and Pater \
Drusus one of the founders." \

granite as the floor stones." \

"The chair is made of the same mahogany as the door, but is more like a stool \
than a chair because the back is very low." \

less bleached from the sunshine." \
    extra {"courtyard"} \
"You can see the courtyard below you. The pavement there is more bleached \
by the sun than the walkway of the wall, probably because the walkway gets \
shade from the sun because of the wall itself." \
    extra {"holes", "hole"} \
"The holes let you peer out from the walls without fear of being spied \
from below." \
    extra {"forest", "trees", "tree"} \
"You can see the Forest very well from here. The walls are about level \
with the lower trees in the forest. Those around the Temple walls are \
mainly Oak and Beech. Some come very close to the walls, you could almost \
touch some of them." \

The elf traveller.

	This guy is my walking billboard. Every 8 hours he changes location, so he is 
either in the Forest of Serenity, Udgaard or Midgaard. He wakes up if slept, and he also stands up. He wanders around these zones while in them. He will attack evil people over level 45 in the Forest of Serenity (only here). He is nosummon/notele. While in Udgaard or Midgaard, he will size up pcs and if they are of good/neutral alignment and level 50, he will invite them to the Valley of Serenity. While in the Forest of Serenity, he will greet good/neutral pcs. If they are evil, he will threaten them (then attack if level 45+). During combat, he will attempt to disarm his enemy. He casts lightning bolt as an attack spell and he is able to heal himself. I've tried to make him so he isn't annoying, heh, but don't sue me.
