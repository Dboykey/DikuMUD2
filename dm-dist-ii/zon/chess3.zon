"Long time ago before the times of destruction and despair, The Blanche
and  the Noir clans were close friends. A budding romance rose up
between the beautiful Lanairia and  the handsome Burtonious. Both
kingdoms were pleased with the bonding of their children and their
upcoming marriage would serve to join the kingdoms for all time. Both
kingdoms prepared for months and months  to be ready for this auspicious
occasion. Burtinious presented his wife to be with a small golden dagger
as his wedding gift to her. His words to here were 'My love take this
dagger and if every I stray from your love use it on me, for I never want
to be far from your sweetness. The wedding day dawned on a gentle  summer
day with not a  cloud to mar the sky. As the wedding was about to proceed
it was noticed  that Burtonious was no where to be see. Groups from both
kingdoms were  sent out in search of the  wayward prince but he was
never found. Trackers found horse prints in the ground indicating
someone had galloped away from the castle at an outstanding speed. The
princess  Lanairia was inconsolable and eventually took her own life with
the very dagger that her love had given her as a wedding gift. Her father
King Blanche was  furious and declared war on King Noir. To this day the
two kingdoms fight bloody battles when ever they meet. The fields between
the kingdoms eventually becoming named 'the killing fields'"
