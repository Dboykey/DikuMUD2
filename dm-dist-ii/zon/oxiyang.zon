"&lThe outskirts of xiyangcheng ( City of the Eastern Sun ). It
 contains a few guard posts, an wine shop and a boat shop. It is from
 here that you can enter XiYangCheng or find Shaolin and Huashan.
 Made on 13 July 1994 by Telegrim (Andrew Ng) eng30072@nus.sg

Zone Notes:
The zone was about 1/2 way finished when handed onto new builders. Many
rooms where left un descr. amd  the zone lacked extras totally. Mobs
where  not descr and  alot of the stuff did not fit the theme of the mud.
Raven and silencer too the zone and worked on it a bit, completeing rooms
and adding extras to 1 zone. Due to personal problems raven dropped out
and Palio took over. Extras where added to both zones. Room descr changed
a bit to fit the mud. Directional errors where fixed and mobs loaded into
the correct positions. Extra weapons where made and  more rooms added in
an effort to bring the zone up to playable level. No quest was made at
this time but one is coming. Questions and comments may be sent to :
Palio@blinksoft.com or (Silencer) KMT2701@ritvax.isc.rit.edu"

	The Book of the Fighting Arts

	Vol. 1

		Oriental boxing, generally known as ch'uan-fa (fist way) or
	or wu-shu (martial art) can be readily classified into two major
	groups :

	a)      the external (wai-chia), often known as Shaolin Temple
		boxing;
	b)      the internal (nei-chia), most commonly represented by Tai-
		chi-ch'uan, the soft dance-like system sometimes called
		shadow boxing.

		The external systems are classified by fast muscular move-
	ments stressing rapid punching and kicking techniques, whereas the
	internal uses slow movements, stressing posture, breathing and the
	use of intrinsic power, or ch'i. The term kung-fu means skilled
	performance and does not only refer to martial arts.

	Shaolin Temple boxing (Shaolin-ssu Ch'uan-fa)

		According to tradition, this form of fighting was taught to
	the monks in the Shaolin Temple by the great Zen master
	Bodhidharma. He taught them the basis of a fighting system to
	strengthen their bodies and minds. After he died, he left two
	books, the I Chin Ching (Muscle Change Classic) and the Hsi Sui
	Ching (Marrow Washing Classic), which contained the essence of
	his teachings.

		The styles known as Shaolin are many and various. There
	are long open movements with high kicks and gymnastic jumping and
	jumping and rolling movements; upright postures, low kicks to the
	groin and knee, and the use of the open hand. Many of the Shaolin
	systems are named after animals, such as the Tiger style (Hu Ch'uan),
	Praying Mantis (T'ang Lang), Dragon style (Long Ch'uan), Phoenix
	(Fung Ch'uan) and White Crane (Pai Hao) - usually the techniques
	resemble to some extent the animal the style is named after. For
	example, the White Crane style features blocking actions which
	resemble the opening movements of a crane's wings, while the Tiger
	style uses claw-like movements of the hands.

	Huashan Sword Fighting

		There are two basic oriental sword types : the chien,
	which is a straight, double-edged weapon and the tao, which has
	a heavy single-edged curved blade.

		The Huashan school has its own chien-fa ( sword-fighting
	skill ) and its own way to making a sword. The Huashan Sword is
	famous for its superby craftsmanship and its undulling edge.
	It is rumored that there is a pact between the Black Robes
	and the Huashan school that makes the sword magical in nature.

		Not much is known about the school as there are many
	requirements and pre-requisites to be met before a practitioner
	is allowed to practice the skills.

	The History of XiYang

	Vol. 1

	XiYangCheng ( City of the Eastern Sun )

		This city was built after the unification of the entire
	Orient. Before that, the Orient was divided into many states
	with warring warlords lording over their domains. This took
	place for over a few centuries, until the emergence of the
	warlord Huang. Having better steel (black steel alloy) and
	better trained troops (fighting techniques he invented himself)
	and being a brilliant strategist and warrior, he crushed all the
	other warlords, who were then united against him. Their efforts
	proved futile because Huang clan had become too powerful by then.
	Thus the Huang dynasty was established.

		XiYangCheng is the product of the Huang dynasty. Huang
	himself directed the building of the city and encouraged commerce
	and furthered education. He provided funding for research into
	the various sciences and, himself is interested in culture.

		The city is built on an isolated part of the southern side
	 of the island, with high impassable mountains to the north,
	 providing an excellent position to defend from. Huang then built
	 a fleet of warships to explore the Northern Sea.

	XiYangCheng ( City of the Eastern Sun )

		The city has grown over the years, then Huang relocated
	most of the city to build his Imperial Palace, the Imperial
	Library and the Imperial University.

		The Imperial Palace is huge, with many buildings unoccupied
	except for the guards and the treasures within. The Imperial Palace
	is out-of-bounds to most, except those he fancies. His personal
	guards, specially trained, guard the Palace and attack intruders on
	sight.

		The Imperial Library contain the works of many scholars and
	wise man. The archives are rumored to exceed what one can read
	in many life-times.

		The Imperial University provides the basic foundation for
	scholars before they go into research at the Library. The
	professors here are the cream of the cream, most of them with
	eccentric tendencies. This is also the center of the Black Robes,
	researching into magic. Black Robes are feared all over the Orient
	for their mystical ways and ability to call upon the magical
	forces. Not much more is known.

	XiYangCheng ( City of the Eastern Sun )

		Although there is the unification by the Huang clan and
	the establishment of the Huang dynasty, many of the other clans
	still hold to their individual cultures and tendencies.

		The prominent clans are the Black Robes, the Yakuza, the
	Hai ninja, the Jihar of the plains, the Drow elves and the
	merchant clan - Qian. They have all pledged allegiance to Huang
	and now fight within themselves for Huang's favor.

		The Black Robes, Yakuaza, Hai ninja and Qian live within
	the city itself. The Jihar live to the south of the Yellow River
	while the Drow elves live under the earth.
