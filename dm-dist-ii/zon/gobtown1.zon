notes 

"&l	The theme of this zone is a labyrinth over-run by goblins which 
leads to a goblin city.  The main mobs of course are goblins, which range 
from between levels 70-80.  This is the city section of the zone.  Eventually
the zone will be expanded to include a castle.  This zone has been in
progress since August of 1996, and undergoes changes frequently. If you
have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this zone, please
e-mail Wynd at pupalijl@wilkes1.wilkes.edu, or Malice at
garubaja@wilkes1.wilkes.edu.  Any questions dealing specifically with the
city can be directed to Malice/Oops. 
	
Special Thanks:
	I (Malice/Oops) would like to take time to thank all those people 
that helped me and/or supported me through making the zone.  First, I'd 
like to thank Zig, who explained anything and everything I had a question 
about right from the beginning.  Secondly, thank you to Jager and Nexus 
who took the time to explain shopkeepers to me.  Thirdly, thank you to 
Palio, Whistler, and Saor, who edited and checked the zone.  I'd also 
like to thank Batlin in advance for making a great quest to add to the 
zone, which will be put in very shortly.  Also, thank you to everyone who 
supported me throughout making the zone, including all of the above, 
along with Dangerboy, Wonko, Shanna, and Boyz.  And finally, a very 
special thank you to Wynd/Wynne, who had the initial idea for the zone, 
let me co-write with her, and made the whole zone making experience a 
fun one.  I couldn't ask for a better partner.  Thank you all so much. =)"
