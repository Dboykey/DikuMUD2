/*
  The format is to some extent self explanatory. There is only one rule that
  needs to be observed, namely that it is required that the 'index' is the
  first keyword to occur for each spell definition.

  Following is a description for each of the fields:

  'index'

    The appropriate SPL_XXX from values.h. If you wish to experiment with
    you own spells, you can NOT add extra SPL_XXX values, nor change the
    SPL_TREE_MAX, since the server was compiled with the original values.
    You can however, select any existing spell and modify it completely
    to your needs.

  'name'
    The name of the spell which is used for casting, teaching, etc.


  'tochar'
    This message is sent to the caster when caster is differnt from the
    target. Message is sent using
    the ACT format where $1n is the caster and $3n is the OPTIONAL
    target. If your spell does not require a target, then you should
    not use $3n. Notice that the described effect is shown regardless
    of wheter the spell will succeed or fail! You should therefore
    be careful in your wording not to imply that the spell is a success.
    For example, this could be used for the spell heal:

       You lay hands on $3n while chanting 'sanctus dominus'.

    And if you fail, the spell should send the message 'nothing happens'.
    Similarily a finger of death may be:

       You convincingly point your pinky at $3n.

    Or you may even do

       A small ball of black slime flies from your palm towards $3n.

    Still not implying if you succeeded or not. You can leave the field
    empty if nothing is to be generated, but I suggest that the minimum
    is to at least send an Ok like this:

       tochar = Ok.
       toself = Ok.

  'tovict'
    As 'tochar' but this message is sent to the target.

  'torest'
    As 'tochar' but this message is sent to the rest of the room.

  'toself'
    As 'tochar' except this message is used when target equals the caster self.

  'toselfroom'
    As 'toself' except show to his surroundings.

  'acttype'
    One of A_ALWAYS, A_HIDEINV or A_SOMEONE. It has effect on the messages,
    tovict, torest and toselfroom.

  'realm'
    Either ABIL_DIV for Divine spells or ABIL_MAG for Magic spells.
    This is the 'realm' that the spell draws it power from, i.e.
    a mage attempting to cast resurrection (DIV realm) will use
    his DIV as the power, not his MAG. Likewise, resisting a
    mage spell will require the MAG ability, not the DIV.

  'sphere'
    The sphere in which the spell is placed. The spheres are used for
    defense, and can thus to some extent make a cleric capable of
    resisting mage attacks if they for example share the fire sphere.

  'func'
    The symbolic name of DIL procedure which executes the spell
    (with zone info). Notice that the ones marked 'INTERNAL' should
    be left alone since the spell implementation has not been converted
    from C to DIL.

  'minpos'
    The minimum required position to cast the spell. The value is
    interpreted literally as defined in POSITION_XXX (see values.h).
    Thus if minimum position is standing, you can only cast this spell
    while standing.

  'mana'
    Amount of mana used by the spell.

  'turns'
     How many ticks it will take to cast the spell (important for combat).

  'targets'
     Search parameters for finding the unit and target types. A rather
     complicated issue, but it is much like findunit, with a few very
     important additions:

         FIND_XXX
            Just as in findunit, this determines what environments are sought
            when a spell is cast. Obviously, a fireball would be SURRO and a
            locate char would be WORLD or ZONE.

         TAR_IGNORE
            When this bit is set, nothing is processed and the argument
            string is passed directly to the spell routine.

         TAR_CHAR
            Only units of type CHAR (PC / NPC) will be accepted as valid
            targets (if not of such a type, no mana is wasted).

         TAR_OBJ and TAR_ROOM
            As above, but for rooms and objects.

         TAR_AUTO_SELF
            Means that when no argument is given, the spell is cast upon
            the spellcaster by default (remember TAR_CHAR also!)

         TAR_SELF_NONO
             Means that the spell in question can not be cast on yourself.

         TAR_SELF_ONLY
             Means that the spell in question can only be cast on yourself.

         TAR_FIGHT_VICT
             If the spellcaster is in combat, the spell will automaticaly
             target his opponent if no argument is given.

         TAR_FIGHT_SELF
             If the spellcaster is in combat, the spell will automatically
             target himself if no argument is given.

  'mediums'
     What the spell can cast from and on. Also rather complicated, here goes:

     MEDIA_SPELL
       When set, the spell can be 'cast'. Notice that a spell like mana boost
       is not castable.

     MEDIA_POTION
       When set, the spell can be applied to potions (in zones).

     MEDIA_WAND
       As for potions but on wands.

     MEDIA_STAFF
       As for wands but on staves.

     MEDIA_SCROLL
       As above, but on scrolls.

     MEDIA_SELF_NONO
       This is used in comination with the MEDIA_STAFF. When this bit is set,
       the staff will NOT cast the spell in question on the user of the staff.
       Usually all peaceful spells will omit this bit, while all attack spells
       will include this bit.

  'check'
     Is a self-check, a resist (opponent), or an ignore type.
     Attack damage spells use SPLCST_IGNORE since the damage
     routine does all the nessecary caluculations and resisitance
     checks.
     Special spells, such as remove curse, also use SPLCST_IGNORE
     since they need to calculate resistance for each individual
     object.
     Spells such as BLINDNESS use SPLCST resist because the victim
     is entiteled to a saving throw.
     Spells such as clear skies, create water and protection from
     good, uses SPLCST check because the caster is not 'fighting'
     anyone, thus it is merely a check to see if his skills are
     adequate at the moment of casting.

  'offensive'
     Set to TRUE if it is an offensive spell, and FALSE otherwise.

  'fumble'
     The 0% - 99% risk of fumbling the spell. Usually 0%.

  'attack clothes'
  'attack sleather'
  'attack hleather'
  'attack chain'
  'attack plate'
     A number list like this {50,30,5}, where the first number is the
     minimum amount required to roll to give damage. The second number
     is the base damage when successful, and the third is what the excess
     is divided by before it is added to the damage.

        if (roll >= num1)
           damage = num2 + (roll - num1)/num3

     'roll' is the total of dice rolls, resistances, bonuses, skills, etc.

  'race human'
  'race elf'
  'race dwarf'
  'race halfling'
  'race gnome'
    Each of these are assigned a number from -3 to +3. The number
    is an indication of how easy it is for the given race to learn the
    spell in question, i.e. it affects the teaching skill-point cost.
    -3 is extremely hard, -2 is very hard, -1 is hard, 0 normal,
    1 easy, 2 very easy, 3 extremely easy.

    For example, dwarves could have a -3 penalty on fireballs due to
    their anti-magical nature. Elves could have a -3 on darkness and
    a +2 on light.


These are the power organization of spells (just as for weapons)

       Guide:         (3, 4, 4, 5, 6)

  2) harm, dispel evil, colourspray, firestorm, icestorm, lightning bolt,
     stinking cloud, acid ball, solar flare, meteor shower

Dunno if you agree on this, but lets try it... This table lists how
the level 4 spells (8, 9, 9, 10, 11) will be modified against
different armours.
This can be used as an alpha template when making all sorts of spells.
