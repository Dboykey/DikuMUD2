                           Please note

Denmark is a country. Danish is a language. Danes are the people living in
Denmark.  A danish is famous Danish pastry. Valhalla is made by Danes.
(Yes, we're tired of being mistaken for Swedes and Dutchmen). Valhalla
is the new version of the old DikuMud by the same people.

Diku is: The department of computer science at the University of Copenhagen
