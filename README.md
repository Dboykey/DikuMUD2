# DikuMUD2
DikuMUD II from 1997

February 2020, Michael Seifert

I've compiled it for Ubuntu 19. Trying to make the old wheels turn on a 64 bit architecture :) 

A few notes

First, get the mplex/mplex up and running. This program accepts (telnet) connections and in turn communicates with the dmserver

Secondly, run dmserver.

To compile zones
