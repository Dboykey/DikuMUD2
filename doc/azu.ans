                          Automatic Zone Update (AZU)

For builders it is possible to automatically upload zone changes for
the zones they are building. This however requires a password, so that
we (and you) can be sure that no one else is tampering with your zone.

A zone which you want to be able to upload for AZU should have your
password as the very first line of your file in the following format:

/*pwd:<password>*/

for example:

/*pwd:mypassword*/

It is very important that it is the first line of the file (since we
use the UNIX command `head -1`) and that there are NO spaces at all.

When all is set, you can syntax check your zone (with or without a
password) by uploading it to the 'in/' directory. Wait a few minutes
and the result will be placed in the 'out/' directory.

When you feel the zone should be included for AZU, simply upload it
to the 'upload/' directory. Wait a few minutes, and the result will
be placed in the 'out/' directory. Notice that the result MUST
contain the confirmation of your password AND no syntax errors for
the AZU to be successful. It is important that you use the filename
assigned to your zone (usually it equals the symbolic zonename with
the '.zon' extension).

You should know, that the file is not processed before it is more than
five minutes old! This is done to ensure that your file does not get
compiled before it is completely uploaded.
