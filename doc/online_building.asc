                   Online Building in DikuMUD
                      - Why we don't do it

As the header suggests, this is not  a  description  of  the  new
online-editing  facilities in DikuMUD. Rather, it is a discussion
about the philosophy which makes us not implement such a feature.

An area in a MUD (or in any text adventure game, for that matter)
should  be  considered a work of art. The atmosphere of each room
should be carefully crafted, and should form an integral part  of
the  overall 'feel' of the area; no room should be thrown in sim-
ply as filling material.  The  intellectual  effort  involved  in
writing  a  truly fine area should be comparable with the writing
of a short-story - this is not a haphazard venture, but something
one should go about with respect and care.
   With a mental effort of this magnitude involved, it should  be
clear  why  we  don't  consider the possible advantages of online
building to be greater than the costs.  Quality  building  should
involve  careful  thinking  about the theme of the area; mapping,
and finally the writing of the decriptions. These tasks  are,  in
my  opinion,  best  carried out with your favorite editor (as one
prejudiced in favor of DikuMUDs, it's easy to claim that  no  de-
cent MUD-area has ever been output by 'ed').
