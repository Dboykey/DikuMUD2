describes what makes a good zone... Read it! 




What *is* a good zone? Before I get into the various types of areas, 
there are a number of common elements in them.
First of all, everything in an area (including the area itself) needs to 
have a reason for being there and a reason for being in the condition 
that it is. If there's a guardpost at the entrance to a keep and the 
guards are actually intended to block or attack intruders, don't put them 
in an adjacent room and expect people to enter that room and meet the 
guards. Have them take shifts in the actual entranceway, and call out to 
the resting guards if attacked. Or give them some other means of 
performing their guard duties. Also, give them "schedules" to follow. 
Most guards currently spend their entire lifetime awake and alert. That's 
crazy: they never sleep, they never eat, they never drink. That is 
another need for schedules of mobs. They need a means of obtaining food. 
While many animals out in the wilderness can just root around for nuts or 
the like in the ground, a guard can't very reliably search around in his 
guard room for a leg of mutton -- not daily, at least. The food needs 
either to be brought to him, or he needs to go obtain it -- perhaps at 
the local bakery or restaurant. 
The second common theme is tied closely to the first. We need to build a 
virtual ecosystem around the areas, and tie everything together. If 
there's a tribe of troglodytes living here, why? Where do they get their 
food and water? Do they have a leader? Why is he their leader? How do 
they react to strangers or intruders? Surely they wouldn't led somebody 
waltz up to their leader's chamber. If somebody picked off some of their 
solitary guards, then they might make some conclusions and organize a 
strike force against the party rather than allowing the party to wait 
until each of them is alone before engaging in battle (case in point, the 
Shiriffs in the Shire). Even a guard, if hungry enough, will drop his 
post and go in search of edibles. Also, mobs placed in uncomfortable 
temperatures will similarly need a reason for existence. Why has it not 
moved away from this place already? Has it found a particularly warm or 
sheltered room and not had the courage to risk trying to find a better 
place? Did it loot a warm jacket from the body of an adventurer and 
therefore be comfortable? Is there a stream nearby that reduces the 
intolerable heat?         
A third common theme that would make many of the areas much better would 
be having more objects present. If you go into a kitchen, is it really 
empty other than some 2-dimensional tables and such in the description of 
the room? A lot of stuff should be present in the PCs (or NPCs) search 
around long enough. This would be important for a reason other than just 
adding more realism to the system. Currently, if the PCs find an object 
in a hard area, it is more than likely a good and useful object. This 
should not be the case; surely even the challenging mobs use standard 
items as well, if only for building fires and the like. Just because he's 
a hardened warrior/mage doesn't mean he uses a flint&steel that's any 
different than Joe Fighter's. Nor does it mean that you should attempt 
not to bundle him down with anything but items "suitable" to his majesty 
and stature. If he needed to build a fire, he'd be out of luck in that 
case. Right? Utilitarian items are quite useful for a number of reasons. 
Objects on mobs should not be limited to those that the PCs will find 
useful as treasure and loot.
 
I believe that zones come in a number of different varieties, depending 
on what type of atmosphere and zone you are trying to create. The first 
and perhaps most common type of area is the quick journey into the 
unknown. The usual dikumud area of Moria is a prime example of this. The 
area itself has only about 30 to 40 rooms, and yet, when the correct 
power of characters enters, they are challenged quite effectively. One of 
the methods of exploring this type of zone is to make short raids into 
it, pushing in as far as possible before the party is weakened too much. 
Then the party goes back and recuperates, and comes back 10 ticks later 
and pushes a different direction. Often, there a particular party is able 
to push only so far into the area (if it's designed well) and thus they 
will always be kept wondering what *is* in that room beyond all those 
warriors. This is a good way of making the best out of a small area. 
However, one thing that was ignored in that area is the fact that a 
number of different hostile mobs are present in the same room in many 
cases. Scuffles would undoubtedly break out, and thus the mobs themselves 
would add flavor to the game.
Another type of zone is much less frequent. It is the long-term trip, the 
adventure that requires planning and travel. The site of the adventure is 
often very far from any civilization as the characters know it, and they 
must travel through unknown and uncharted lands to arrive there. A prime 
example of this type of adventure is the AD&D modules D1 and D2 (Descent 
into the Depths of the Earth), where the party travels into the 
underworld in search of a drow city. When my party travelled there, we 
took mules and over a months worth of rations (and we ran out of that 
food). Further, we were cut off in part from our gods, and the unknown 
sights, sounds, and sensations of the underworld environment prevented us 
from ever fully relaxing or concentrating -- for instance, we never once 
got a good night's sleep, and it was virtually impossible for the magi to 
rememorize spells. We were so far from the outside world that even such a 
spell as a wish was not powerful enough to transport us back to the 
overworld (we researched such information before embarking). A possible 
example of a diku area like this would be the duergar settlement on 
Copper. Moria was rewritten to be much more challenging, and it had a 
small hidden trapdoor in its deepest levels that led to a vertical tunnel 
leading six or seven rooms straight down -- a fly or levitate was 
required to traverse these rooms, and a potion of either was difficult to 
get at times; the spell did not exist. Once at the bottom of the vertical 
shaft, a broad river spread out below, and the duergar settlement was 
hidden far down one of the branches of the river. This type of area 
requires a great deal of planning, not only for how to get there with 
enough supplies, but also for how to return safely (recalls won't be 
nearly as common). Another key point about these types of zones as 
compared to the above quick-zone type is that often a powerful party will 
amass more wealth than it is able to carry (often the wealth is in the 
form of objects such as rugs, furniture, etc) and they are then forced to 
choose what to continue to take (do we drop 4 days worth of food so we 
can carry these rugs?) with them. Anything they drop will be picked up by 
scavenging mobs or the like soon after they leave, so they are able to 
take only what they can easily carry (if they're forced to flee from a 
battle, they may even lose their mules/etc, so they must also worry about 
organizing who carries which). Another example of adventures like this 
would be the 10-hour quests that were held at Copper and presumably are 
held on other decent muds. Note also that travel to other planes would 
fit the category of this type of zone quite nicely.
 
To go back to the other thread present in this post, the fourth theme 
common to all zones, but in particular this type, is the use of the 
party: a group of adventurers joining up on the principle of safety in 
numbers. Having a well-rounded party is essential for the larger and more 
distant zones, and often useful even in day-to-day activities. Also, 
being in a party while wandering the wilderness might be crucial in a 
number of situations. A ranger, for instance, could safely navigate a 
party through a particular confusing and befuddling copse of trees. Or, 
if you are unfortunate enough to lose your link, one of the party members 
could guard you until you return (something we need to seriously consider 
is what to do with linkdead peoples. My first impulse is the most 
ruthless: leave them there. If a mob comes along, it can attack just like 
normal. They're a standard character, except they have no actions. 
Alternatively, we can make them into an NPC at that point and have them 
controlled that way (attempting to preserve their own life) until the 
player returns). One method of promoting the use of parties would be to 
keep NPC followers/etc in the game. Thus, familiars can be created, and 
henchmen and other types of followers can be utilized without losing them 
when the player leaves the game. Also, the use of defense formations 
among parties can also promote their use; for instance, a mage would join 
up with a powerful warrior for their mutual benefit: each would provide a 
different method of attack. In larger parties, the warriors would form a 
ring around the weaker members during marching formation, thus protecting 
them from many dangers. If we can make the characters separate enough 
individuals that no character is capable of perfectly performing more 
than a few types of actions, then the players will find a use in parties. 
If, however, each character has the abilities of just about all the 
others, then a primary reason for grouping is lost.
A fifth common theme between most zones, touched on briefly in the 
troglodyte discussion above, is the fact that nearly all adventuring 
zones need to have a sense of uncertainty about them. In moria, there are 
bazillions of orcs and kobolds roaming around. Often, they coincidentally 
cluster in a specific area, creating quite a challenge (an often 
unexpected one) for somebody just waltzing through from room to room. One 
of the primary examples of what *not* to do for this is either Midgaard 
or, even better, the Shire. In the shire there are shiriffs, who are 
intended to be guarding the city. All they do is wander around or sit in 
their guard posts: they guard nothing. Meanwhile, people sitting around 
killing the things in the town, one by one, with no (organized or other) 
resistance other than the single mob in melee at the time. It can be 
reasonably argued that the shire is thought to be a place where violence 
does not occur, and thus the shiriffs have never had any need to actually 
protect their town. However, after their *entire* town gets wiped out 
once or twice, I'd think they'd lose their innocence in a hurry, and 
probably even become a virtual police state if such acts continued, 
blocking off all entrance to or from the town. It is unrealistic to ask 
that such calculations and drastic changes be made on the fly. Therefore, 
the creator of the zone should consider the treatment that each mob in 
his zone will receive (am i just making them all pincushions? why?) and 
then decide whether or not the mob would still be around at this point 
(the point at which the players enter the area). If not, change the
situation to correct the problem. In areas that are not frequently 
traversed (such as the duergar settlement), this uncertainty can be 
created by the room descriptions themselves. In uncharted territory, just 
about anything can be used to keep the players paranoid (can and should, 
in many cases). The need for uncertainty that was mentioned above with 
regards to the shire is based on areas that will be used rather 
frequently, as a place very close to "home" for the players and thus a 
frequent hang_out/slaughterhouse. One other means of keeping uncertainty 
in the game has been proposed a few times already, namely that we have 
wandering mobs running around. This probably should be done, but in many 
cases a wandering mob will not provide much uncertainty after a while, 
especially in zones that are travelled frequently enough that the player 
knows the zone like the back of his hand (such as the "wandering" zork 
adventurer). Interestingly enough, moria still provides a great deal of 
uncertainty even when the players knows all the rooms by heart. Yet 
another possible method of introducing uncertainty in a frequently 
travelled zone is to use variable mob stats. For instance, Joe Farmer has 
5d5 hp. Therefore, sometimes he'll be tough and sometimes weak; this 
might confuse some of the stupid players for a while (which is good).
 
The third type of zone has mostly been discussed (disgust?) in the above 
sidetrack: it is the well-travelled town that is nearby or in the home of 
the players. If the people there are so innocent as to go out at night or 
walk alone on the streets with all these bloodthirsty players running 
around with axes, that's insane. Many hometowns or nearby cities would 
turn into complete police states when faced with such circumstances.
One method of combatting this is to give citizens of the city a "citizen" 
flag (visible or otherwise) meaning that if attacked, they'll yell for 
the guards who will promptly race to their rescue. Anyways, we need to 
come up with some good methods for keeping the inhabitants of the more 
frequented towns from dying often.
The fourth type of zone is a combination of the long-journey and the 
civilized nearby area. It would be a city in a distant land, where a 
journey of weeks was required to reach it. It would, however, be a 
civilized and well-defended city where the players could bumble about in 
relative security. Of course, harsh actions might be taken if they 
attempted to engage in combat with anything, but until then they might be 
relatively safe. Of course, serious consideration would need to be taken 
to see whether or not such an area could be a possible player_home, 
because that would lose much of the "mystic" aura of the city to have 
players actually living there. Obviously, it would have an inn, but that 
inn might often run out of free rooms (if the players travelled 
there...lots of things could have too) or charge an exorbitant amount. 
Something like that to keep them thinking that it's a privilege to stay 
in the city.
The fifth type of zone is a natural setting, a walk through a forest or a 
vast desert or deep in a jungle, in natural surroundings where the 
players can concentrate on the imagery of the landscape around them 
rather than the constant hassle of hackNslash. Similarly, if such zones 
don't have very many mobs, the same types of questions need be asked in 
reverse: why aren't there mobs here? What's keeping them from moving in, 
or what's killing/driving_away those that do? If answers to these 
questions are not readily forthcoming, the standard ecosystem for that 
sector_type should be implemented. 
 
A sixth theme that should be common to many zones is the idea that if 
there is the possibility of travelling in a direction, it should be 
available. Too many people make a path through a woods, but only rooms 
for that path. I'm sure god&grump can devise methods of mass-creating 
low-ram_usage rooms to buffer trails like that, or even to cover the 
entire forest. Too often are people "prevented from travelling in a 
direction because of a tall tree." Obviously, this theme is virtually
meaningless in an underground setting.
 
Well, I shall post more as more comes to me. If you think you have a good
area but none of these general descriptions fit it, please tell me about it.
I'm sure I blatantly left something out, and I'd be interested to know
what. I hope I didn't kill the board...

There were a myriad of reasons for posting this, some of which follow.
1. As Grump said, there's no such thing as too many ideas.
2. The ideas and themes mentioned in the post were in no way an attempt 
to constrain or limit the areas created. Obviously, they are only 
ideas&suggestions; I thought that would be clearly evident. I am not 
dictating how zones should look or feel. I am giving ideas and the like 
for areas that would have more substance than some other types of areas. 
There are two things that need to be responded to here. The first thread 
that I posted concerned common themes that should be present to some 
extent in all areas. The ideas I presented here are generic enough that 
they should not in any stifle or hinder the creation of anybody's idea of 
a good area. Needing a reason for a mob to be somewhere, or giving a 
third dimension to the ecosystem or geography or civilization of the area 
is common sense, right? I was merely verbalizing what many people have 
come to accept. Obviously, not all zones will or should conform to one or 
more of these "themes," but in general I believe (there's that phrase 
again. Gee, are these *really* only opinions?) that these ideas should be 
taken into consideration during the creation of a zone.
Concerning the second thread of the post, the specific types of zones, 
again this is obviously not intended as a means of restricting the types 
of zones that are created. However, if you take a step back, I still 
believe that nearly all zones (consciously or subconsciously) will fit 
into one (or more) of these rough categories. As the end of my post 
stated, I most likely blatantly left out a large category in here. 
Perhaps you would agree and label it as "other." But that kind of defeats 
the purpose of specifying.
3. For people who are working on their area, but haven't fully come up 
with all their ideas about it, or are concerned that there isn't enough 
substance in their area, or people just beginning to create an area, 
there are plentiful ideas and thoughts in here. If your area *happens* to 
fit one of these themes quite nicely, then there might be an idea or 
suggestion in the discussion of that theme that you hadn't considered or 
had considered but discounted. Better to display information than to 
assume that others will come upon it on their own.
4. Another reason for posting such themes and ideas is to include a rough 
summary of some of the things that we will need with our mob behaviour 
functions. A great number of people may not have full knowledge of the 
type of AI behaviour that we are envisioning, and therefore may have 
already passed over an idea that they decided was "impossible to do." 
5. Although the areas themselves will (hopefully) be unique, the various 
themes and discussions could help the creator put his or her zone into 
place in the grand scheme of things. These are the types of zones that 
will be around his/her zone (I still hold to my opinion that nearly all 
zones fit one of the general themes), and as such the creator will be 
more prepared to connect the zone to the "outside" world (more ideas as 
to how and where to integrate the zone, etc.). 
 
Further, your last statement that this is going to be an unusual system 
and thus should have unusual areas is also off-base. None of the ideas in 
my post were "usual" ideas. In fact, most of them could and should be 
considered to be "unusual" of their own accord. Very few of the 
"standard" diku areas do I approve of, and as such I have here offered 
some alternate methods of creating a zone, methods that I believe would 
provide more substance than most standard areas possess.
 
As an addendum to the first post, I have another suggestion that might 
serve to improve the quality of a zone. Sometimes zones are created as 
"linear" sets of rooms (case in point Warg Alley), and there are no 
side-roads or the like. This severely weakens the substance and 
three-dimensionality of the area. Moria, for instance (one of the few 
standard zones of which I do approve) has a great number of side-passages 
leading off from the main passages, and even the main passages split often.
--Dillo. More posts as I find time -- parents nagging me bigtime.
