Guild documentation
-------------------

The syntax for the SFUN_GUILD_MASTER is as follows:

special SFUN_GUILD_MASTER
"Guild               = <name>
Guild Enter Quest    = <namelist>
Guild Enter Cost     = 50000
Guild Leave Quest    = <namelist>
Guild Leave Cost     = 200000
Guild Exclude Quest  = <namelist>

A namelist is one or more names. A names is a string surrounded by the
tilde '~' symbol (instead of quotes which can't be used, unfortunately).

For example, this is the fighters guild as of writing:

special SFUN_GUILD_MASTER
"Guild               = ~Udgaard Fighter~
Guild Enter Quest    = ~Rabbit Stew Complete~
Guild Enter Cost     = 50000
Guild Leave Quest    = ~Mary's Pot Retrieved~
Guild Leave Cost     = 200000
Guild Exclude Quest  = ~Udgaard Mage Quitter~"


This could be a paladin guild (assumes that many other guilds also
exist):

special SFUN_GUILD_MASTER
"Guild               = ~Paladin~
Guild Enter Quest    = ~Wight Warrens Quest~ ~Holy Quest~
Guild Enter Cost     = 0
Guild Leave Quest    = ~Lonely Wolf Quest~ ~Paladin Harakiri Quest~
Guild Leave Cost     = 1000000
Guild Exclude Quest  = ~Sorcerer Quitter~ ~Necromancer Quitter~ ~Udgaard Mage Quitter~ ~Udgaard Thief Quitter~ ~Evil Quest~"

Notice that when quitting a guild, the "<guild> Quitter" quest flag is
automatically set. If quitting a guild by killing a teacher, the mentioned
quest is set AND the name "banished" is added!
No more loss of skill points.

The Udgaard Guilds now exclude each other in the following way:

Has been a            Can never become member of
----------            --------------------------
Udgaard Thief         Udgaard Cleric
Udgaard Cleric        Udgaard Thief
Udgaard Fighter       Udgaard Mage
Udgaard Mage          Udgaard Fighter

More will be added when new guilds are ready, and new guilds should also
consider the previous occupations of a member. Clearly a paladin guild
should not accept old thieves, assassins, mages, sorcerers, necromancers,
etc.
